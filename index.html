            The Problem
          </h2>
          <p>
            We view death as the irreversible collapse of the physical dynamics
            that sustain consciousness: the point at which the
            process-world-line terminates. Existing interventions fail to
            guarantee the survival of the same conscious process:

                slows substrate failure but leaves consciousness vulnerable to a
                single point of failure: the biological brain. One accident, one

                  Death remains the single greatest source of human suffering
                  and loss, every year, roughly 60 million people die, each
                  taking with them irreplaceable knowledge, relationships, and
                  perspectives. Synconetics addresses this not through
                  speculative promises but through rigorous, verifiable
                  engineering. If successful, the technologies developed here
                  would represent the most significant advancement in human
                  wellbeing in history: the elimination of involuntary death.
                  Unlike approaches that require faith in untestable claims
                  about consciousness, our methodology prioritises empirical
                  verification and gradual, validated transitions. Philanthropic
                  funding at this stage supports foundational research that
                  commercial interests typically avoid due to long time
                  horizons, yet the potential impact dwarfs nearly any other
                  cause area.
