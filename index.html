                  Death remains the single greatest source of human suffering and loss—every year, roughly 60 million people die, each taking with them irreplaceable knowledge, relationships, and perspectives. Synconetics addresses this not through speculative promises but through rigorous, verifiable engineering. If successful, the technologies developed here would represent the most significant advancement in human wellbeing in history: the elimination of involuntary death. Unlike approaches that require faith in untestable claims about consciousness, our methodology prioritises empirical verification and gradual, validated transitions. Philanthropic funding at this stage supports foundational research that commercial interests typically avoid due to long time horizons—yet the potential impact dwarfs nearly any other cause area.
